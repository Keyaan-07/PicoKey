Yup, I wanna make a hardware key. I was inspired by yubikey, [orpheus pico guide](http://orpheuspico.hackclub.com/docs/pico/guides/passkey), and the [RP2350 hardware key](https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92/PicoDucky) by ```@Rudy```

I might start from tomorrow.

Beginning my work on PicoKey from today. The things i will try to accomplish:
> PCB Trace USB Connector
> Use an RP2350 instead of RP2040 this time:(
> smallest possible footprint

I wanted to use the RP2040 but it is apparently not secure enough so now i have to use the RP2350 :(

Gotta start with the schematic
